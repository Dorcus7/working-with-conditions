/************************** Exercise 1 ***********************/

// List five different examples where a web app uses a conditional statement.


  //1. Show a 'Sign Up' button if the user is not logged in, otherwise show a 'Log Out' button.
// 2. Display different UI themes based on user preferences.
// 3. Show an error message if the form validation fails.
// 4. Load more items in a list when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.
// 5. Enable the 'Submit' button only when all required fields are filled in.


/************************** Exercise 2 ***********************/

let cash = 18;
let lunch = "granola bar";

if (cash > 10) {
  lunch = "sandwich";
}

if (cash > 15) {
  lunch = "fancy sandwich";
}

if (cash > 20) {
  lunch = "lobster rolls";
}

// After we execute the above code, what will be the value of `lunch`?
// Think about it for a bit, write down a guess below, then log the value of `lunch` to the console to see if you were right.

// fancy sandwich

console.log(lunch);

// Try changing the value of `cash` (you can directly change the value we assign to it above) to the following values.
// For EACH value, write down your guess as to what the value of `lunch` will be, then log the result to the console
// to double-check your answer. If writing `console.log` statements in this file, you only have to write one
// `console.log` statement for this question.

// - What will be the value of `lunch` when `cash` is 12?
// "sandwich"

// - What will be the value of `lunch` when `cash` is 4?
// "granola bar"

// - What will be the value of `lunch` when `cash` is 35?
// "Lobster rolls"

// What happens if you rearrange the if statements? Move the first `if` statement (the one with the condition `cash < 10`) and its whole code block (that is, all three lines of the if statement) down below the three lines of the last `if` statement. Then CHANGE the value of `cash` to 18.
// "fancy Sandwich"

// Write down here what you think the result will be. Then log the result to the console to check your assumption.

console.log(lunch);


/************************** Exercise 3 ***********************/

//let userAge = 25;

} else {

}

// Run the above code to see what it logs to the console.

// What will it log if we change the age to 25? Write your guess here, and then make that change and see if you were right.

// If we change the age to 25, it will log 'You can vote.'


// People whose age is 18 can vote in the U.S, but currently, if `userAge` is 18, we'll log that the user cannot vote.
// Fix the condition of the `if` statement so that it works correctly.

/************************** Exercise 4 ***********************/

// let userResponse = prompt("Give me a number, any number, and I will tell you whether it is positive or negative.");

// Remove the `//` from the front of the line above. (Feel free to add them back when you're done with this section, so you don't get prompts for a problem you're not working on.)


// Create a conditional statement that will check to see if the number is positive or negative. Alert (or log to the console) a message telling the user which it is.

if (userResponse > 0) {
  alert("The number is positive.");

const quantity = 47;
const salesTotal = retailPrice * quantity;
const profit = salesTotal - wholesalePrice * quantity;


// Write a conditional statement for your online store. If the profit is greater than $400, log to the console, 'You are good for today!'. If the profit is less than or equal to $400, log the string, 'You need to keep working!'


if (profit > 400) {
